- Current System isn't always updating. If app is restarted, and docked, then we can safely update it
- Buy orders when unset are not always clearing the table
- Name not added, or different from spreadsheet (include a space or something) Not populting commander on carrier tab entries. ie 'Death Magnet' vs 'DeathMagnet'
- In-transit, deliver to different carrier adds row to wrong sheet
