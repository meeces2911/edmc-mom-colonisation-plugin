# Change Log

## 1.2.0

### What's Changed
* Added In-Transit Commodity tracking. If you're hauling something to a carrier, and that carrier has `Delivery` tracking enabled, then a new entry will appear on the Carrier tab with the **Delivered** checkbox unticked. Once the cargo has been sold to the Carrier the checkbox will be ticked. (in theory)
  * In-Transit Commodity tracker requires both the spreadsheet settings to be updated and the CMDRs plugin to have the setting enabled to enable this for a given carrier
* Added new setting **Assume Carrier Buy is for Unloading to SCS** which controls whether to enable delivery tracking for the SCS Offload sheet separately. Set this to **False** to disable the delivery tracking
* Added Status Indicator widget to EDMCs display. This will change to red if the spreadsheet hasn't been connected to successfully
* Added 'Carrier' widget to EDMCs display. This is used by the In-Transit delivery tracker to know which carrier you are working on.
  * It will default to the carrier you were assigned to initially (ie, the one mentioned on the System Info sheet)
* Added new settings options to hide both widgets
* Handle **CarrierLocation** Journal Events - this means that after the carrier jumps, and the owner is still on line, the spreadsheet will automatically clear the scheduled jump field if they are not on the carrier
* All saved settings can now be cleared by pressing the **Clear all settings** button. (Hopefully only i'll need to use it, but its there in case anyone else needs it too)
* Made initial start up slightly (only slightly) faster by batching some of the intial spreadsheet calls
* Handle **CarrierDepositFuel** Journal Events - this means that 'dontating' fuel to a carrier now counts as a delivery
* Automatically add an entry to the System Info sheet, if docking to an Unknwon SCS for the first time

## Fixed
* Fixed wrong carrier sheet being updated on carrier jump if you'd docked to another carrier since setting the jump
* Re-enable early event queuing prior to Google authentication is complete. This means we don't miss out on the start-up events
* Settings are now saved correctly and should persist between restarts
* New carriers/sheets not being correctly added to all the places needed when updates to the spreadsheet were detected

### Known Issues
* Buy Order table will be updated even when setting a Buy order to something we don't track. No values are changed though
* Even though the spreadsheet is chosen at authorisation time, its still hardcoded in the plugin to use a specific one.

## 1.1.2

### Fixed
* A silent crash for new CMDRs using the plugin for the first time and it trying to record usage stats. (Restarting EDMC would have fixed the problem, but there is currently no way for CMDRs to know something has gone wrong)

* Carrier Sheets with ' in them failed to update the carrier sheet correctly when buying or selling from the Carrier
